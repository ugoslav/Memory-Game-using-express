Assuming that you have Node in your system and you don;t know how to run an express application , here's a bit of a guide for you.
After cd-ing into the cloned repository, open up the terminal and run "npm install". This will install the dependencies required for this project to run.
If everything went smooth,you should be able to see a "node modules" folder in your cloned repo now.
Run "npm start" in the terminal to start the localserver, and then just copy paste the "localhost:..." in your browser.
And lastly,you can change the command used to start the server as per your own wish. All you have to do is go to "package.json" file,
and change the key value under "scripts" (which is start by default) into whatever you want.
So,for example, if you change it to "cranberry", you have to run "npm run cranberry" to start the server now.
